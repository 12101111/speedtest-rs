# TODO

## General
- general refactor of code.  This is embarrassing. ðŸ˜• I'm still learning rust and i'm getting this out as fast as possible and learning correct techniques as i go.
- figure out what the UI should be
- once mechanics are completed, implement actual testing (ie sustained uplaod, download, etc)
- better error handling on bad server id
- figure out how to cross compile for windows/mac/linux
- doc
- testing

## lib.rs
- faster random byte generation for upload

## cleanup / refactor
- clean up main.rs
- clean up lib.rs
