= TODO

== main.rs
- enforce server as a number only?

== lib.rs
- ping how to deal with a server that isn't found (now i get an unwrap error)
- implement "best" server
-- sort by 'distance'
-- get the top N unique distance
-- profile with a quick ping
- in ping_server the function seems clunky , need to review it
- ping server average of N pings
